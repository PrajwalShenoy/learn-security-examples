Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability in insecure.js arises from its failure to validate and sanitize user input, 
specifically the username input. This oversight makes the code vulnerable to NoSQL injection 
attacks. Without proper validation and sanitation, an attacker could manipulate database queries, 
potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
The secure.js version addresses this vulnerability by implementing input validation and sanitation 
mechanisms. It ensures that the username is a string and then sanitizes it by removing any 
non-alphanumeric characters before executing the database query. This approach prevents NoSQL 
injection attacks by ensuring that the input is properly formatted and free from malicious 
characters that could alter the behavior of the query.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Tampering, in the context of cybersecurity, refers to the unauthorized alteration of data or code. 
It directly violates the Integrity aspect of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) 
triad, as it compromises the accuracy and reliability of the data or system.
In the scenario provided, if an attacker successfully tampers with the username input or database 
queries, the integrity of the system is compromised. This could lead to unauthorized access or 
alteration of sensitive user information, undermining the trustworthiness and authenticity of the 
data in the system. Ensuring data integrity is crucial for maintaining the security and reliability 
of any information system.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
To enhance the security of the system and further protect against various attacks, the following measures can be implemented:
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks 
    by restricting the number of requests a user can make within a specific timeframe.
Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies that require 
    complex and unique passwords, reducing the risk of password-based attacks.
Encryption: Use encryption to protect sensitive data during storage and 
    transmission, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.
Authentication Mechanisms: Implement robust authentication mechanisms, 
    such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to securely manage user authorization and session management.
Regular Updates: Regularly update software dependencies and libraries 
    to patch known vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface.
Logging and Monitoring: Set up logging and monitoring systems to detect and 
    alert on suspicious activities or security breaches, enabling prompt response and mitigation.
By incorporating these additional measures, the security posture of the system can be significantly strengthened, 
providing a more comprehensive defense against a wide range of cybersecurity threats.
