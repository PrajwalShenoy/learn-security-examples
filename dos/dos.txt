The vulnerability in insecure.js is due to the lack of error handling for database operations. 
This omission makes it vulnerable to a Slowloris-style Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where 
an attacker can send requests with invalid IDs, causing the server to hang indefinitely. 
In contrast, secure.js addresses this vulnerability by incorporating error handling, ensuring 
that the server responds with an error message instead of hanging, even if a database operation 
fails or takes a long time.

Additional Security Mechanisms to Prevent Such Attacks:
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests a client can make within 
a specified timeframe, preventing attackers from overwhelming the server with excessive requests.

Input Validation: Rigorously validate user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and 
criteria, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or malicious inputs causing disruptions.

Timeouts: Set timeouts for database operations and other critical tasks to avoid indefinite hanging. 
If an operation exceeds the specified time limit, terminate it and respond with an appropriate error 
message.

Monitoring and Alerting: Deploy monitoring systems to detect unusual traffic patterns or spikes 
that may indicate a DoS attack. Set up alerts to promptly notify administrators, enabling them 
to take swift action to mitigate the attack.

Load Balancing and Redundancy: Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple 
servers and ensure redundancy in critical components. This approach minimizes the impact of a 
DoS attack on any single server or service.
