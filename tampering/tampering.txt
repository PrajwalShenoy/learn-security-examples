Q. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability resides in the insecure handling of user input during the registration 
process (/register route). In the insecure code, user input (req.body.name) is stored in 
the session without proper sanitization, leaving it susceptible to XSS attacks. The secure 
version addresses this vulnerability by implementing input sanitization using the escapeHTML 
function. This function escapes special characters in the user input, preventing XSS attacks 
by ensuring that the input is treated as plain text rather than HTML, thereby mitigating 
the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.

Q. Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Tampering violates the integrity aspect of the CIA triad. It compromises the trustworthiness 
and reliability of data through unauthorized modification or alteration, leading to potential 
misinformation or unauthorized access.
