Q. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

1. Session Secret Management: In the insecure version, the session secret is set as "SOMESECRET," 
which poses a security risk if compromised. This vulnerability could lead to session hijacking or 
spoofing, as attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the session data. In contrast, 
the secure version dynamically sets the session secret using ${secret}, assuming 'secret' is securely 
provided. This approach enhances security by ensuring robust management of the session secret, 
reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

2. HTTPOnly Flag: In the insecure code, the absence of the httpOnly flag allows client-side scripts to 
access the session cookie, exposing the session identifier to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By 
setting httpOnly: true in the secure version, the session cookie becomes inaccessible to client-side 
scripts, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks and preventing malicious actors from accessing or manipulating 
session data.

3. SameSite Flag: The initial code's lack of the sameSite flag makes the session vulnerable to Cross-Site 
Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, as the session cookie can be sent with cross-origin requests. By setting 
sameSite: true in the secure version, the session cookie is not sent with cross-origin requests, reducing 
the risk of CSRF attacks and ensuring that actions performed on behalf of the user are legitimate and 
authorized.

Conclusion:
The secure version addresses these vulnerabilities by adopting best practices for session management, such 
as securely managing the session secret, restricting access to session cookies, and preventing them from being 
sent with cross-origin requests. This enhances the application's overall security posture, reducing the risk of 
unauthorized access and data theft.


Q. Which CIA properties do you think Spoofing violates?

Spoofing primarily violates the confidentiality and integrity aspects of the CIA triad by enabling unauthorized 
access to sensitive information and compromising the trustworthiness of data through impersonation or manipulation.
